This repo contains all the Terraform modules that are reusable across different applications. There is nothing wrong with creating a module in the application's repo, but if it is general enough put it here instead.

It is assumed that this repository is checked out "next to" the repos using it (i.e. both the applications and this repo should be cloned into the same folder).
